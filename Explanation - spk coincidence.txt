Inputs:
SpkTimeStamps_ref = spike time stamps of the recording of a channel, A for example, used here for reference;
SpkTimeStamps_comp = spike time stamps of the recording of a channel, B for example, used here for comparision;
TimeWindow = time window chosen for coincidence analysis, in seconds;

Outputs:
CoincidenceRate = the coincidence rate calculated for spike coincidence, comparing channels A and B, in a temporal window chosen in TimeWindow;
CoincidenceMaxRef = a mask created with the coincident times (positions in the vector of Time stamps) in the reference channel;
CoincidenceMaxComp = a mask created with the coincident times (positions in the vector of Time stamps) in the comparision channel.
