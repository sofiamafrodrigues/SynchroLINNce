Inputs:
SpkClip = an average of spike clip, with 80 ms;
AllSf = sampling frequency;
AllGain = gain of the recording, as used in the acquisition.
Outputs:
SpkSlope = average slope, obtained by doing (SlopeUp + SlopeDown) / 2;
SlopeUp = rising slope, obtained by numerical derivation;
SlopeDown = dropping slope, obtained by numerical derivation;
AmpUp = amplitude peak calculated based on the rising edge;
AmpDown = amplitude peak calculated based on the dropping edge;
AmpAvg = average amplitude.
