Inputs:
RecordClip = recordin clip to be analyzed;
AllSf = sampling frequency;
AllGain = voltage gain used in acqusition;
ThresholdMax = threshold of 0 to 1 for marking the spike, in relation to the maximum amplitude of a spike found in the window of 1 second (ex 0.6 (60%)); 
DeltaTMin = time interval between one spike and another, to avoid marking the same spike 2 times, due to possible variations in morphology (ex 0.1 (100 ms));
AmpCutMin = minimum amplitude expected for the spike (ex 0.225 mV); 

Outputs:
SpkTimeStamps = time stamps of the spikes;
SpkMaxStamps = time stamps of the peaks of the spikes;
SpkClips = patchs of the signal that correspond to each spike (80 ms);
SpkNumber = number of spikes found on the analyzed recording;
SpkFireRate = average firing rate of the spikes;
AvgSpkMaxStamps = average of the max spike stamps;
MaxSpkMaxStamps = maximum of the max spike stamps;
MinSpkMaxStamps = minimum of the max spike stamps;
AvgDeltaT = average of the temporal distance between the spikes;
MaxDeltaT = maximum of the temporal distance between the spikes;
MinDeltaT = minimum of the temporal distance between the spikes.
